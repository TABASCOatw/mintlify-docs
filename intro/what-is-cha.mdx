**Chain Abstraction** is the principle of removing blockchain-specific friction from the user experience. Instead of forcing users to think in terms of chains, wallets, bridges, and tokens, chain abstraction allows them to interact with apps and assets **as if the entire multi-chain ecosystem were a single, unified environment**.

## Why Chain Abstraction Matters

Web3 today is fragmented:

- Users must manage **multiple wallets** for different chains.
- Each chain has its own **native gas token** (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.).
- Bridging assets is **complex and error-prone**.
- dApp developers must handle inconsistent **tooling and standards** across chains.

Chain abstraction fixes this by shifting complexity away from users and into infrastructureâ€”so users and developers get one consistent experience across the entire ecosystem.

## Key Properties of Chain Abstraction

**1. One Account Across All Chains**  
Users interact through a **Universal Account** with a single address and balance across ecosystems (EVM, Bitcoin, Solana, etc.).

**2. Unified Liquidity**  
Transactions automatically route liquidity behind the scenes, removing the need for bridges or manual swaps.

**3. Universal Gas**  
Users can pay gas fees with **any token** from **any chain**, abstracting away the need to hold native gas tokens.


Particle Network enables chain abstraction by coordinating these three pillars through its **infrastructure**
