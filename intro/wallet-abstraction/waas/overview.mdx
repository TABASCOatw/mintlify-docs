## Integration Packages

Particle Network offers two main packages for integrating Web3 functionalities into your dApp:

### Particle Connect
An all-in-one solution that provides:
- Social login integration
- Traditional wallet connections
- Account Abstraction capabilities
- Unified interface for all authentication methods

## Account Abstraction (AA) Overview

Account Abstraction enhances user experience by:

1. **Smart Contract Wallets**: Replaces traditional EOA wallets with programmable smart contract accounts
2. **Flexible Authentication**: Supports various authentication methods beyond private keys
3. **Programmable Security**: Custom security rules and recovery options
4. **Gas Abstraction**: Enables gasless transactions and sponsored fees
5. **Batch Transactions**: Multiple operations in a single transaction

### Key Benefits
- Simplified onboarding through social logins
- Enhanced security with programmable account rules
- Better UX with gasless transactions
- Reduced friction in transaction signing

## Modular Implementation

Particle's AA stack is designed to be modular, allowing developers to:
- Choose their preferred smart account implementation
- Select bundlers and paymasters
- Customize the authentication flow
- Integrate with existing infrastructure

The full ecosystem of Particle Network's AA stack is diagrammed below:

Regardless of a developerâ€™s intended use of AA within a given application, modularity complements ERC-4337 AA at any level, especially within the context of native applications. Below is a table depicting the native and external implementation of different components within Particle's AA stack:
