# Chain Abstraction & Universal Accounts

Particle Network is building the infrastructure for a unified Web3 experience through two core innovations:

## Chain Abstraction

Chain abstraction is a developer-focused layer that removes the complexity of cross-chain interactions:

- **Single Interface**: Developers can build multi-chain applications using one unified SDK
- **Automated Bridging**: Cross-chain asset transfers happen automatically in the background
- **Unified Liquidity**: Access liquidity from multiple chains and ecosystems

<Info>Chain Absraction at the account lever is enabled by the [Universal Accounts SDK](/ua-api-reference).</Info>

## Universal Accounts

Universal Accounts are smart contract wallets that work across all the supported chains:

- **One Account,One Balance, Any Chain**: A single account works across multiple blockchains
- **Chain-Agnostic**: Users don't need to know which chain they're on
- **Universal Gas**: Pay fees in any token from any chain

## Key Components

Particle Network combines three powerful features:

1. **Universal Accounts**: Smart accounts with unified balances across all chains
2. **Universal Liquidity**: Automatic bridging and liquidity routing
3. **Universal Gas**: Pay transaction fees in any token
