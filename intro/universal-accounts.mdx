Particle Network’s Universal Accounts play a crucial role within Particle Network’s implementation of chain abstraction, providing users with a single address, balance, and interaction point across the multi-chain Web3 ecosystem.

Users leveraging a Universal Account maintain one balance and account state across every blockchain. Particle’s Universal Accounts leverage [Universal Liquidity](/landing/modular-l1/universal-liquidity) to automatically execute atomic cross-chain transactions and pool funds from a user's balance across chains to meet the conditions of a given operation. This creates a unified UX, agnostic to any specific blockchain.

By using a Universal Account, user’s not only unify their interface with the EVM and non-EVM ecosystem, but have the ability to deposit and use funds on any blockchain– represented and used as if it existed on a single chain.
