## What Are Universal Accounts?

**Universal Accounts** are smart accounts that work across multiple chains and ecosystems, including **EVM**, **BTC**, and **Solana**:
- A **single address and balance** across all [supported chains](/guides/cha/chains)
- **Gas abstraction** (pay with any token from any chain)
- **Cross-chain liquidity**, handled automatically

By using Universal Accounts, developers can abstract away the fragmented UX of multi-chain Web3 and give their users a seamless, chain-agnostic experience.

## Integration Flow

The **Universal Account SDK** is designed for fast, minimal lift integrations. Under the hood, it wraps any existing provider (e.g., Social Logins, MetaMask, WalletConnect) and routes all transactions through the user's Universal Account.

The general flow:
1. **Configure** the account using a single config object.
2. **Wrap** the existing provider using the SDK’s wrapper.

Once integrated, all transactions, balance reads, and gas handling automatically use the Universal Account—**no additional code for bridging or gas logic required**.

<Note>
Universal Accounts are smart contract accounts. Existing assets in a user's current wallet are not automatically included. Users can transfer assets into their Universal Account from any supported chain via in-app flows.
