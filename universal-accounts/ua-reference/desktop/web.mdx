## Universal Accounts SDK

The **Universal Accounts SDK** provides a simple, powerful way to integrate Particle’s chain abstraction system into your application. It enables users to interact with multiple chains using a single smart account, unified balance, and flexible gas options.

This SDK allows you to:
- Deploy and manage Universal Accounts
- Send transactions across chains
- Access unified balances and signing utilities

Using the Universal Accounts SDK is the fastest way to implement **chain abstraction** at the account layer—backed by Particle Network’s modular infrastructure.

**The sections below cover setup, usage, and advanced configuration options.**
